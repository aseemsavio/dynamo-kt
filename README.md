Welcome to dynamo-kt â€“ a Kotlin library that simplifies and enhances interactions with the official AWS DynamoDB SDK.
This library provides a set of extension functions, utility classes, and code generation capabilities to make working
with DynamoDB easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable for Kotlin developers.

## Features

* **Extension Functions**: Easily work with DynamoDB using Kotlin's concise and expressive syntax. We've added extension functions to the AWS SDK to streamline common operations.

* **Code Generation**: Say goodbye to boilerplate code when defining DynamoDB tables. dynamo-kt comes with code generation capabilities that automatically generate the necessary code for table definitions, so you can focus on your application logic.

* **Type Safety**: Benefit from Kotlin's type safety to ensure your DynamoDB interactions are free from runtime errors.

* **Open Source**: dynamo-kt is an open-source project released under the MIT License. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Getting Started

### Installation

You need Google's KSP plugin for code generation. It can be added to your project's `build.gradle.kts` as follows.

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "<kotlin_version-ksp_version>"
}
```
Note that the version of KSP is compatible with the version of Kotlin you're running.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.aseemsavio:dynamokt:<version>")
    ksp("com.aseemsavio:dynamokt:<version>")
}
```
